Why use spreadsheets?
- data in 
     *science labs, 
     *other data-intensive classes,
     *research
     
- personal finance

- personal organization

- rudimentary animation/gaming challenges

So fractions are rendered as 12/30, each integer from one is rendered as subsequent dates. The earliest you can do on sheets is 12/30/1899, so I’m thinking that maybe it’s just interpreting integers as “days since 12/30/1899.” It’s been 45196 days since that date and, sure enough, if you input it on those broken cells, it shows 9/27, today’s date

** I also think that the first time a date was entered, that cell is a date *until* you change its format explicitly. Even entering a new type of data isn't enough.
