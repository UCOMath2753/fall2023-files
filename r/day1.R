cos(5)

log(10) ## natural logarithm
## ln(10) ## 'ln(x)' is not the natural log in R
log10(10)

log(10, base = 10)

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 

# e^7, nope, its exp(7)
exp(7)


## ?command, takes you to a help file
?cos
?log

## in our heads, this works
1/3 - 1/4
1/12

## on the computer, it ... doesn't quite
(1/3 - 1/4) - 1/12
## this small number is essentially zero
## but not, due to representation of numbers
## on computers and rounding error
